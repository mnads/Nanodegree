	U,p=scipy.stats.mannwhitneyu(rain,norain) gave me a nan p value.
	Seemed however if I ran the same one line code on the Original Data
	set file, it did calculate correctly. The workaround was to
	calculate the new p value using the more lengthy code. </SPAN></FONT>

	Do you have any other insight about the dataset that you would like

	<P STYLE="font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Liberation Sans Narrow, sans-serif">While
	sticking with my conclusion that more testing needed to be done, my
	brain stumbled upon another way to analyze the dataset. You can see
	it in my notebook right under the Overall Entries Hourly vs
	Frequency chart. This chart made me see that most of the no rains
	were with small amounts of Entries Hourly. This made me think to
	filter out(ignore) any row less than 2,500 Entries Hourly from both
	rain and non rain day. From there, I took a random sample of 2,000
	rows from rain and no rain data and analyzed the means. I ran the
	test 2,000 times and everytime the mean was higher on rain days.
	This leads me to believe that ridership during rainy days is higher,
	but this is just an assumption and might not take more variables
	into consideration.</FONT></P>
